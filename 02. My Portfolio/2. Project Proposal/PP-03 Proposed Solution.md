Anagram will be a Python-Flask-based Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to support high school students in managing their study effectively to prepare for exams and assessments. The application will provide an assisted, structured and achievable approach to study planning by accounting for multiple subjects, assessment schedules, and the need for balance between study and rest. The three main goals is to reduce stress, improve organisation, and support more effective exam preparation.

Anagram allows users to:
- Register and log in securely
- View a clearly structured study calendar and timetable
- Manage multiple subjects and associated assessments
- Schedule and organise study sessions based on available time
- Manually add, edit, and track study tasks
- Monitor study progress through visual summaries and charts

***User Experience***
The user experience will be designed to tend to high school students, focusing on clarity, simplicity, and accessibility. The interface will use a clean, modern layout with consistent typography and colour schemes to minimise cognitive load. Students will be guided through the study planning process using clear visual elements such as timetables, dynamic tool suggestions, progress indicators, and reminders.

The application will be accessible across devices and platforms, with offline access ensuring reliability during commutes or in environments with no connection. Feedback mechanisms such as completion indicators and scheduled breaks will encourage balanced study habits and sustained engagement without overwhelming the user.

***Technologies***
Anagram will be based on the following 3rd-part technologies:
- Backend: Python, Flask
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript
- Database: SQLite3, ORM
- Authentication: Flask-Login
- Offline support: Service Workers, Web App Manifest
- Version control and collaboration: GitHub

### User Experience

The user experience will be designed with high school students in mind, focusing on clarity, simplicity, and accessibility. The interface will use a clean layout with consistent typography and colour schemes to minimise cognitive load. Students will be guided through study planning using clear visual elements such as timetables, progress indicators, and reminders.

The application will be accessible across devices and platforms, with offline access ensuring reliability during commutes or in low-connectivity environments. Feedback mechanisms such as completion indicators and scheduled breaks will encourage balanced study habits and sustained engagement without overwhelming the user.

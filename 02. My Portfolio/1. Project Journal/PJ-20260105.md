**Date:** 5 Jan 2026
**Project:** Anagram - HS Exam Study Planner PWA
**Module:** Deliverables

**What I did:**
- Finalised the Project Deliverables section, outlining required parts for submission.
- Completed the Methodology section, defining the Agile development approach and project phases
- Ensured alignment with assessment requirements and marking criteria.

**Why I did it:**
- Clearly defining deliverables sets expectations for what will be produced by project completion.
- A structured methodology demonstrates organised planning and supports SE-12-09 outcomes.
- These sections provide another place to look back to for the remainder of the project.

**Challenges:**
- Keeping descriptions concise while still meeting marking criteria.
- avoiding unnecessary detail that does not contribute to a better product.

**Next steps:**
- The project proposal will continue by identifying the timeline, resources, and budget
- Further refining of writing

**Reflection:** 
Today's work continued to lay the foundation for the project’s structure and direction. With deliverables and methodology defined, the project now has a clear point to guide development and evaluation moving forward.

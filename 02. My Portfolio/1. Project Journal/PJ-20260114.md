**Date:** 14 Jan 2026
**Project:** Anagram - HS Exam Study Planner PWA
**Module:** Project proposal

**What I did:**
- Completed the Executive Summary, combining the problem description, proposed solution, methodology, deliverables, and constraints.
- Reviewed and refined the full project proposal to improve clarity, cohesion, and alignment with marking criteria.
- Finalised the project timeline by adding clear milestones linked to development phases.

**Why I did it:**
- The Executive Summary provides a concise overview of the entire project
- Editing the proposal ensures consistent quality across sections
- A milestone based timeline enforces structure, supports time management, and aligns development with assessment deadlines.
**Challenges:**
- Avoiding repetition across sections while maintaining clear links between planning components.

**Next steps:**
- Begin application design, including wireframes and database schema planning.

**Reflection:** 
Today’s work finalised the project proposal into a coherent document. With the executive summary and timeline completed, the Anagram project now has clearly defined constraints, expectations, and direction, reducing the risk of poor time management during development.

**Date:** 8 Jan 2026
**Project:** Anagram - HS Exam Study Planner PWA
**Module:** Timeline, Resources, Budget

**What I did:**
- Finished the project timeline, mapping development phases to dates using a Gantt chart.
- Completed the Resources section, identifying roles and skills involved in the project.
- Defined the project budget, outlining expected costs and justifying a low-cost development

**Why I did it:**
- A timeline enforces planning and keeps development aligned with assessment deadlines.
- Identifying resources demonstrates an understanding of project roles and feasibility.
- A defined budget shows consideration of practical constraints and real-world development conditions.
**Challenges:**
- Balancing realism in the timeline

**Next steps:**
- Do the executive summary
- Begin application design

**Reflection:** 
The work done on the eighth of January strengthened the project’s  structure. With timeline, resources, and budget defined, the Anagram project now has clear constraints and expectations, reducing the risk of poor time management or scope drift later in development.

**Date:** 3 Jan 2026
**Project:** Anagram - HS Exam Study Planner PWA
**Module:** Problem Definition and Proposed Solution

**What I did:**
- Chose the name "Anagram"
- Finalised the Problem Description for the Anagram PWA, clearly identifying time management issues faced by high school students during exam and assessment periods.
- Completed the Proposed Solution section, defining Anagram as a Python-Flask-based Progressive Web Application.
- Documented core features, defined user experience, identified third party technologies 

**Why I did it:**
- The definition of Anagram fits with the restructuring of the users time, sounding fancier and has a deeper meaning than the other options like 'Studi' and 'Student-studier'
- A clear and well-structured problem definition demonstrates effective project planning
- Establishing this documentation early provides a reference point for future development decisions and prevents deviating from the purpose of the project.
- Clearly linking features to user needs strengthens the overall justification of the project.

**Challenges:**
- Avoiding mixing the problem description and proposed solution required careful editing.
- Ensuring the feature list was specific enough to demonstrate technical depth without committing to extra functionality.

**Next steps:**
- The project proposal will continue by identifying the deliverables, methodology, timeline, resources, and budget
- Further refining of writing

**Reflection:** 
This session laid the foundation of the Anagram project. Clearly articulating the problem and solution clarified the project’s direction and constraints. The documentation now provides a place to look back on for development and evaluation, reducing the risk of misalignment with assessment criteria later in the project.
